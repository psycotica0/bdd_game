- Combiner to combine elements
- Filter pieces to put certain kind of input one direction, and another in another
- Periodic Wall
- Decay. Certain items might need to be out in the air for some time to "ripen"
  before being consumed.

- Inducer. Straight piece, but it "teleports" a copy of the piece that goes
  through it to the piece above, even though they don't touch.

  Like =~=
       ===
  If '=' is a normal piece, and ~ is my inducer, when an item enters the
  inducer from the left, the piece below it "magically" gets one entering from
  the left too

- Maybe some semaphore, so when an item goes over a spot it opens a gate
  elsewhere for flow control

- Spreader: if 3 pieces went in, each would come out in a different direction
